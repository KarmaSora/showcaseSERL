    "description": "Game files are ready, now you need to configure two things: the database (MongoDB), and the authentication provider (Firebase).Pokemon Auto Chess use mongoDB to store its data and Firebase for authentication. Those 2 dependencies requires credentials to use. Credentials will be stored in a .env file in the root folder of the repository. If you do not have a .env file in your root repository, make one now and open it in notepad.MongoDBYou can either setup the mongo database using the cloud based MongoDB Atlas or using the local installation.In both cases, create a database named dev with an empty collection named botv2. Then retrieve the URI connection.If you are using MongoDB Cloud, you may need to create an admin user under Database Access > Create a New User. Make sure to Add Built-in Role > Atlas admin.A cloud uri will look like smth mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/dev?retryWrites=true&w=majority.The local uri will look smth like mongodb://localhost:27017/dev.In order to play against bots, you will need to load bots data into your newly created database. In MongoDB Compass, import bots data (./db-commmands/botv2.json) in the botV2 empty collection.In the .env file at the root folder, add the mongoDB URI:MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/devFirebasePokemon Auto Chess uses the Firebase authentication module to let players create accounts and login to the game.First create an account and a firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/.Inside the firebase project, create a web app called for example pokemon-auto-chess-test.",

Install the dependencies using the requirements.txt file.pip3 install -r requirements.txtUsageStep 1) Prepare the response to reviewers in a spreadsheet and export it as a CSV file, like the input.csv.At least three columns are required to be able to parse the CSV file. Have a look at as an example ofStep 2) Run main.py with two arguments: the input CSV file and the output file name.# show helppython3 main.py -h# usagepython3 main.py input.csv output.texStep 3)Select all fields (columns) from the CSV file that shall be included in the generated document.$ python3 main.pySelect at least three fields (ID, reviewer comment, author response)(x) ID(x) Comment* (x) Response( ) Action( ) Where( ) Status( ) ResponsibleColor coding of responsesThe response boxes are color-coded based on the ID field, which is the first selected field. To determine different reviewers, the prefix of the ID field value is used until the first delimiter (., -, or :). E.g., Rev1.3 becomes Rev1 and R1:3 becomes R1.In the next step, a custom LaTeX color is created for each reviewer that can be adjusted.colorlet{colorRev1}{blue!15!white}CustomizationTo customize the generated LaTeX file, you can either adjust template.tex or replace it with your own file. The script will replace the placeholder %%%%%custom-command%%%%% and %%%%%ccomments%%%%% in the template.tex file with the generated content.LicenseCopyright Â© 2023-2024 Andreas BauerThis work (source code) is licensed under MIT.",
