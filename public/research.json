Install the dependencies using the requirements.txt file.pip3 install -r requirements.txtUsageStep 1) Prepare the response to reviewers in a spreadsheet and export it as a CSV file, like the input.csv.At least three columns are required to be able to parse the CSV file.

To determine different reviewers, the prefix of the ID field value is used until the first delimiter (., -, or :). E.g., Rev1.3 becomes Rev1 and R1:3 becomes R1.In the next step, a custom LaTeX color is created for each reviewer that can be adjusted.colorlet{colorRev1}{blue!15!white}CustomizationTo customize the generated LaTeX file, you can either adjust template.tex or replace it with your own file. The script will replace the placeholder %%%%%custom-command%%%%% and %%%%%ccomments%%%%% in the template.tex file with the generated content.LicenseCopyright © 2023-2024 Andreas BauerThis work (source code) is licensed under MIT.",
